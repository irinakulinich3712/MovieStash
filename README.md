Movie search app

The application is supported with the movie database API https://www.themoviedb.org/
It provides the users with access to movies and their information with the help of some filters and criterias.

The users can sign up and log in to their accounts. 
In their account the user is taken to the page with popular movies. The user can switch to viewing the top-rated movies instead. The movies can be searched by names and filtered by genre, country or year.

The movies from API can be added by the users to their watch list.
From the watch list the users can add movies to their favourites, while writing a review for that movie.

The recommendations section is based on the user's favourites, similar or related movies are recomended there.
